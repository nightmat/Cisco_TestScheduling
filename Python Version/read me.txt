Hi, the Python code file includes the following parts:

1: Main: used to initialise the input and run the function for getting the output (scheduled test jobs);

2: CiscoJobSchedulingExecute: main class for scheduling used to set the input, set the parameters (e.g., maximum of generation iterations) and run the algorithm.

3: Problem, Problem_scheduling: used to define our scheduled problem for calculating the fitness function as we discussed.

4: Search, SSGA, OpOEA and Individual: used to implement the (1+1) Evolutionary algorithm.

3: Job: used to define to a test job including the following attributes: 
   1) jobID used to identify the job; 
   2) maxrunTime means the max execution time for running the test job; 
   3) requiredresource means the specific test resources required by a test job; 
   4) priority shows the priority for a test job (the value is simulated from 1 to 10 currently).
Notice that the input for job list should include values for these attributes. 

4: Resource: used to define to a test resource in the pool including the following attributes: 
   1) resourceid used to identify a particular resource;
   2) weight used to represent the weight for a test resource based on the available number of test resources in the pool 
      and associated number of features; 
   3) currentbuild shows whether the test resource is in the current setting up, if the currentbuild is true, the 
      uploadcost will be 1 min. If the currentbuild is false, the uploadcost will be 6 mins for e20/snoopy and 4 mins for
      the others (the value for cost time can be changed); 
   4) subnetcost shows the cost for setting up a correct subnet (the current value is simulated from 1 mins to 10 mins); 
   5) isavailable used to identify the availability of a test resource at a given time. 
Notice that the input for test resource list should include values for these attributes.
